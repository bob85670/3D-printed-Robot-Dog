# 3D-printed-Robot-Dog
This is a project about programming 3D printed Robot Dog to walk on uneven terrain by Arduino.     

The hardware used is ESP32 Development Board E1 as the Microcontroller unit and MPU-9250 as the Inertia Measurement Unit. It contains accelerometer and gyroscope which can detect the rotational movement of the three axis: Pitch, Roll and Yaw. It is useful for inverse kinematics calculations and control system of the robot trajectory. Two algorithms, walking gait and self-balancing algorithms are implemented with corporations of log joint movement (driven by electric servomotoes).
